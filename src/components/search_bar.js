// searchbar
// user types something in searchbar and list updates based on 'something' so need to make an api request to the youtube api   

import React from 'react'; // we need to import this because whenever we translate the jsx to normal javascript it turns into a call like 'React.createElement' // so we need to import react into all of our components that we write that have jsx.




const SearchBar = () => {
    return <input />
}; // defining component

// React components can show other components, so because of there is no connection between components we need explicitly declare a connection between them.

export default SearchBar; // now we can use searchbar from other components
